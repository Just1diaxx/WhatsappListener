_Whatsapp listener is an android app builded with Flutter to secretly listen to whatsapp voice messages._

_The default folder that whatsapp uses to save voice messages files is:_
**<Your device> >> Android >> media >> com.whatsapp >> Whatsapp >> Media >> Whatsapp voice notes**
**Here you'll see a lot of folders, in the format <year><week>, to select the most recent voice message, select the last folder and the last audio file**

**_Hope you'll like the app! ðŸ˜ƒ_**
